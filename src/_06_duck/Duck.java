//1. Create a Duck class in your java project. Add its member variables and methods to match the CRC card. Now add the code for the constructor of the Duck class:



//2. Now pick your favorite animal and describe it in CRC form with at least 2 member variables and 2 methods (write it on the whiteboard).

//3. Create a java class for your animal including:

 //     member variables
  //    methods(with sysouts)
  //    a constructor that sets the member variables


//4. Create a new java class. This will be a "runner" or "driver" class, so it will need a main method.

//5. In your runner class, create a Duck object (instance) by calling its constructor as follows:

//Duck daffy = new Duck("donuts",5);

//      Now you have a duck object, you can make it quack:

//daffy.quack();

//6. Now create an instance of your animal (Hint: see step 5 above) and call its methods.
